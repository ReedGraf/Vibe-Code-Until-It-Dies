# Vibe-Code-Until-It-Dies

Welcome to the digital equivalent of a house of cards built during a mild earthquake. This repository is a testament to "vibe-driven development"â€”a process where code is written based on pure instinct, a disregard for best practices, and an unhealthy amount of caffeine.

**Disclaimer:** Every line of code here has a 50-50 chance of working. It either works, or it doesn't. If you encounter a bug, that's not a bug; it's a feature. If the whole thing crashes your browser, consider it a feature with attitude.

## The "Projects"

This collection contains a couple of web-based games that were coded with more hope than skill.

### 1. Minesweeper

-   **File:** `minesweeper/index.html`
-   **The Vibe:** A sleek, modern, dark-mode take on Minesweeper for people who enjoy anxiety.
-   **The Twist:** Forget what you know about Minesweeper. Your first click is safe. ONE other random tile is also safe. Every single other tile is a bomb. The goal is to find the two safe spots in a field of certain doom.
-   **The Bullshit:** The bomb placement logic is... creative. The win condition is checked with the fervor of a squirrel looking for a nut it buried last winter. It *probably* works. The timer is there to remind you how much of your life you're wasting.

### 2. BluCoin Clicker

-   **File:** `BluCoin Clicker/index.html`
-   **The Vibe:** A classic incremental/clicker game where you can become a fake crypto-millionaire. It has a cool blue theme and an animated title that triggers after 1000 clicks to reward your descent into madness.
-   **The Twist:** It's about "BluCoin," which is definitely not a real cryptocurrency. Don't try to cash out.
-   **The Bullshit:** The save/load system uses `localStorage` and a prayer. If your score vanishes, consider it a market crash. The background music is supposed to start after your first click, but it might have other plans. The mute button is your only real friend here. The game's balance is non-existent; have fun.

## How to Run This Masterpiece

1.  Clone this repository (if you hate trees).
2.  Navigate to a project directory of your choosing.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.
4.  If it doesn't work, try refreshing. If it still doesn't work, well, we told you so.

## Contributing

Feel free to submit a pull request, but be warned: you are entering a fragile ecosystem. Touching anything might bring the whole fragile structure tumbling down.

**Golden Rule:** If it works, don't touch it. If it doesn't work, it's probably not worth fixing.

Good luck. You'll need it.

This Readme was made using AI as well minus this section. My goal is to prove how dumb "vibe coding" really is by creating the most pointless projects until the LLM is unable to do anything without encountering an error.
